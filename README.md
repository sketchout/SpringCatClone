# SpringCatClone

This Project is a close from https://code.google.com/p/springcat/.

[ SpringCat is a network application framework which helps users develop high-performance and 
high-scalability network applications easily. 
It provides an abstract, event-driven, 
asynchronous API over various transports such as TCP/IP and UDP/IP. ]

It's just clone and will make a sample code for that.
